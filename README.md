We created this app prototype during the UTECH hackathon beta. It's an app that helps its user find any shops near them based on the product description.
It was created on the basis to encourage physical shopping. 
On a search of the product it will show the users any vendors nearby that sells the products. So, no mindlessly scouring every nook and cranny to find a specific product and no waiting for days for a online product to arrive.
